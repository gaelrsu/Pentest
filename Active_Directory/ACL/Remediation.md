# few recommendations 
```
    Auditing for and removing dangerous ACLs
Organizations should have regular AD audits performed but also train internal staff to run tools such as BloodHound and identify potentially dangerous ACLs that can be removed.

    Monitor group membership
Visibility into important groups is paramount. All high-impact groups in the domain should be monitored to alert IT staff of changes that could be indicative of an ACL attack chain.

    Audit and monitor for ACL changes
Enabling the Advanced Security Audit Policy can help in detecting unwanted changes, especially Event ID 5136: A directory service object was modified which would indicate that the domain object was modified,
which could be indicative of an ACL attack.
