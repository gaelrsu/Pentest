# What is DCSync
Consist in stealing the Active Directory password database by using the built-in Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol, who is used by the Domain Controllers to replicate data from the domain. 
This allows an attacker to mimic a Domain Controller to retrieve user NTLM password hashes.
To do that we have to request a Domain Controller to replicate passwords via the DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All extended right.

wemust have control over an account that has the rights to perform domain replication (a user with the Replicating Directory Changes and Replicating Directory Changes All permissions set). 
Domain/Enterprise Admins and default domain administrators have this right by default.
