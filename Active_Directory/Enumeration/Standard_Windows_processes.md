## Session Manager Subsystem (smss.exe)
```
The Session Manager Subsystem, or smss.exe, is an essential process that plays a pivotal role during the initialization of the Windows operating system.
It's one of the first processes to run when a Windows-based system boots up.
Its primary function is to create and manage user sessions and provide a foundation for other critical system processes to execute within these sessions.
In essence, it acts as a bridge between the Windows kernel and the user-mode environment.
