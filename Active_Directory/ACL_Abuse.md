# Access Control List (ACL) Abuse
The settings themselves in an ACL are called Access Control Entities (ACEs). 
Each ACE maps back to a user, group, or process (also known as security principals) and defines the rights granted to that principal. 
Every object has an ACL, but can have multiple ACEs because multiple security principals can access objects in AD. 

There are two types of ACLs:

    1-Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) - defines which security principals are granted or denied access to an object. DACLs are made up of ACEs that either allow or deny access. When someone attempts to access an object, the system will check the DACL for the level of access that is permitted. If a DACL does not exist for an object, all who attempt to access the object are granted full rights. If a DACL exists, but does not have any ACE entries specifying specific security settings, the system will deny access to all users, groups, or processes attempting to access it.

    2-System Access Control Lists (SACL) - allow administrators to log access attempts made to secured objects.
