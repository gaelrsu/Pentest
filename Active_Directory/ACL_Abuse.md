# Access Control List (ACL) Abuse
The settings themselves in an ACL are called Access Control Entities (ACEs). 
Each ACE maps back to a user, group, or process (also known as security principals) and defines the rights granted to that principal. 
Every object has an ACL, but can have multiple ACEs because multiple security principals can access objects in AD. 

## There are two types of ACLs:

    1-Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) - defines which security principals are granted or denied access to an object. DACLs are made up of ACEs that either allow or deny access. When someone attempts to access an object, the system will check the DACL for the level of access that is permitted. If a DACL does not exist for an object, all who attempt to access the object are granted full rights. If a DACL exists, but does not have any ACE entries specifying specific security settings, the system will deny access to all users, groups, or processes attempting to access it.

    2-System Access Control Lists (SACL) - allow administrators to log access attempts made to secured objects.

if a DACL exists, but does not have any ACE entries specifying specific security settings, the system will deny access to all users, groups, or processes attempting to access it.

Each ACE is made up of the following four components:

    1-The security identifier (SID) of the user/group that has access to the object (or principal name graphically)
    2-A flag denoting the type of ACE (access denied, allowed, or system audit ACE)
    3-A set of flags that specify whether or not child containers/objects can inherit the given ACE entry from the primary or parent object
    4-An access mask which is a 32-bit value that defines the rights granted to an object
## Differentes types of ACEs

    1-ForceChangePassword - gives us the right to reset a user's password without first knowing their password (should be used cautiously and typically best to consult our client before resetting passwords).
    2-GenericWrite - gives us the right to write to any non-protected attribute on an object. If we have this access over a user, we could assign them an SPN and perform a Kerberoasting attack (which relies on the target account having a weak password set). Over a group means we could add ourselves or another security principal to a given group. Finally, if we have this access over a computer object, we could perform a resource-based constrained delegation attack which is outside the scope of this module.
    3-AddSelf - shows security groups that a user can add themselves to.
    4/GenericAll - this grants us full control over a target object. Again, depending on if this is granted over a user or group, we could modify group membership, force change a password, or perform a targeted Kerberoasting attack. If we have this access over a computer object and the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) is in use in the environment, we can read the LAPS password and gain local admin access to the machine which may aid us in lateral movement or privilege escalation in the domain if we can obtain privileged controls or gain some sort of privileged access.


=> ACL abuse can be a great way for us to move laterally/vertically and even achieve full domain compromise.
We can use ACL attacks for:

    Lateral movement
    Privilege escalation
    Persistence

# ACL Enumeration
## Enumerating ACLs with PowerView

```powershell
Find-InterestingDomainAcl
```
Then choose a target and get the SID
```powershell
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
$sid = Convert-NameToSid username
Get-DomainObjectACL -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}
```
We see that the value 00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529 (ObjectAceType) and uncover this page (:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/r-user-force-change-password) showing that the user has the right to force change the other user's password
### Performing a Reverse Search & Mapping to a GUID Value
```powershell
$guid= "00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529"
Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Extended-Rights,$((Get-ADRootDSE).ConfigurationNamingContext)" -Filter {ObjectClass -like 'ControlAccessRight'} -Properties * |Select Name,DisplayName,DistinguishedName,rightsGuid| ?{$_.rightsGuid -eq $guid} | fl
```
### Using the -ResolveGUIDs Flag
```powershell
Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid} -Verbose
```
### Creating a List of Domain Users
```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter * | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SamAccountName > ad_users.txt
#now use a foreach Loop
foreach($line in [System.IO.File]::ReadLines("C:\Users\username\Desktop\ad_users.txt")) {get-acl  "AD:\$(Get-ADUser $line)" | Select-Object Path -ExpandProperty Access | Where-Object {$_.IdentityReference -match 'MYDOMAIN\\username'}}
```
### Investigation / Enumeration of Rights into the 'User-Force-Change-Password' user
```powershell
$sid2 = Convert-NameToSid CanChangePWDUser
Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid2} -Verbose
# we could see GenericWrite privileges over X group. This means, among other things, that we can add any user (or ourselves) to this group and inherit any rights that this group has applied to it.
```
### Investigating the X Group with Get-DomainGroup
```powershell
Get-DomainGroup -Identity "Help Desk Level 1" | select memberof
```
### Investigating the group who contain X group
```powershell
$itgroupsid = Convert-NameToSid "the group who contain X group"
Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $itgroupsid} -Verbose
```
