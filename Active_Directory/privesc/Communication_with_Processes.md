# Communication with Processes

## Check Network Services
```bash
netstat -ano
```
## Named Pipes
Pipes are essentially files stored in memory that get cleared out after being read.
Pipes are used for communication between two applications or processes using shared memory. 
### Enumerate
```bash
pipelist.exe /accepteula
```
```powershell
# powershell
gci \\.\pipe\
```
### Enumerate Permissions
```bash
# check with lsass process  (you have to check the process name with the previous command)
accesschk.exe /accepteula \\.\Pipe\lsass -v
```
### Attack Example
```bash
accesschk.exe -accepteula -w \pipe\WindscribeService -v
[...]
\\.\Pipe\WindscribeService
  Medium Mandatory Level (Default) [No-Write-Up]
  RW Everyone
        FILE_ALL_ACCESS
```
