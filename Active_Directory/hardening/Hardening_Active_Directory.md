# Hardening Active Directory

Things To Document and Track

    Naming conventions of OUs, computers, users, groups
    DNS, network, and DHCP configurations
    An intimate understanding of all GPOs and the objects that they are applied to
    Assignment of FSMO roles
    Full and current application inventory
    A list of all enterprise hosts and their location
    Any trust relationships we have with other domains or outside entities
    Users who have elevated permissions



    The organization should have a strong password policy, with a password filter that disallows the use of common words (i.e., welcome, password, names of months/days/seasons, and the company name). 
    Rotate passwords periodically for all service accounts.
    Disallow local administrator access on user workstations unless a specific business need exists.
    Disable the default RID-500 local admin account and create a new admin account for administration subject to LAPS password rotation.
    Implement split tiers of administration for administrative users. 
    Clean up privileged groups.
    Where appropriate, place accounts in the Protected Users group.
    Disable Kerberos delegation for administrative accounts.
