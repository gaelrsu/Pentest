# Domain Trusts Intro

A trust creates a link between the authentication systems of two domains and may allow either one-way or two-way (bidirectional) communication. An organization can create various types of trusts:

    Parent-child: Two or more domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain, meaning that users in the child domain corp.mydomain.local could authenticate into the parent domain mydomain.local, and vice-versa.
    Cross-link: A trust between child domains to speed up authentication.
    External: A non-transitive trust between two separate domains in separate forests which are not already joined by a forest trust. This type of trust utilizes SID filtering or filters out authentication requests (by SID) not from the trusted domain.
    Tree-root: A two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. They are created by design when you set up a new tree root domain within a forest.
    Forest: A transitive trust between two forest root domains.
    ESAE: A bastion forest used to manage Active Directory.

Trusts can be transitive or non-transitive.

    A transitive trust means that trust is extended to objects that the child domain trusts. For example, let's say we have three domains. In a transitive relationship, if Domain A has a trust with Domain B, and Domain B has a transitive trust with Domain C, then Domain A will automatically trust Domain C.
    In a non-transitive trust, the child domain itself is the only one trusted.
