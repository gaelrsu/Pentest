# SQL Server Admin
It is common to find user and service accounts set up with sysadmin privileges and may obtain credentials for an account with this access via Kerberoasting (common) or others such as LLMNR/NBT-NS Response Spoofing or password spraying.
Use the tool Snaffler to find web.config or other types of configuration files that contain SQL server connection strings :

With Bloddhound we can use this cypher to check for SQL Admin Rights in the Node Info :
```
MATCH p1=shortestPath((u1:User)-[r1:MemberOf*1..]->(g1:Group)) MATCH p2=(u1)-[:SQLAdmin*1..]->(c:Computer) RETURN p2
```
