# what to do after the foothold in the domain

## Remote Desktop
can help for :
```
    Launch further attacks
    Escalate privileges and obtain credentials for a higher privileged user
    Pillage the host for sensitive data or credentials
```
With PowerView, we can use the Get-NetLocalGroupMember function to enumerate members
### Enumerating the Remote Desktop Users Group
```powershell
Get-NetLocalGroupMember -ComputerName NameOfTheComputer -GroupName "Remote Desktop Users"
# the Remote Management Users group existe since the days of Windows 8/Windows Server 2012 to enable WinRM access without granting local admin rights.
```
