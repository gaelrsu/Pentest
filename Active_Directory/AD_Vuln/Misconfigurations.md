# Exchange Related Group Membership
An unmodified Microsoft Exchange installation in an AD environment exposes multiple attack vectors, as it is granted significant privileges. 
The "Exchange Windows Permissions" group can be exploited to grant DCSync privileges to a user. 
Also, the "Organization Management" group in Exchange has considerable power, acting like "Domain Admins" and accessing all domain user mailboxes.

# PrivExchange
The PrivExchange attack exploits a flaw in the Exchange Server PushSubscription feature, allowing any domain user with a mailbox 
to force the Exchange server to authenticate to any HTTP host. 
This over-privileged service can be abused to dump the domain NTDS database or gain access to other hosts within the domain, 
potentially leading to Domain Admin privileges with any authenticated domain user account.

# Printer Bug
The Printer Bug is a vulnerability in the MS-RPRN protocol, allowing any domain user to exploit it and gain access to a print server over SMB. 
It can be used to retrieve password hashes from AD and grant unauthorized privileges. 
The bug can also compromise a Domain Controller in a partner domain if specific conditions are met. 
Tools like Get-SpoolStatus can help identify vulnerable machines.
