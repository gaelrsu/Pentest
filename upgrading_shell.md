How to upgrade a restrictive shell ? 

If Python if already installed :
```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
In Perl :
```bash
perl -c 'exec /bin/sh";'
```
If they are no python and no Perl use VI 
Vi is a text editor but it can also run command : 
```bash
:set shell=/bin/sh
:shell
```

For a no responding shell in linux :
```bash
/bin/bash -i
```
