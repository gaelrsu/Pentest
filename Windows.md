# Responder
Responder is a tool for poisoning the LLMNR and NBT-NS protocols on a network, to allow for credential capture and arbitrary code execution.

The LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) protocols are used by Windows systems to resolve hostnames to IP addresses on a local network. If a hostname cannot be resolved using these protocols, the system will broadcast a request for the hostname to the local network.

Responder listens for these broadcasts and responds with a fake IP address, tricking the requesting system into sending its credentials to the attacker.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder#usage
./Responder.py -I eth0
```
